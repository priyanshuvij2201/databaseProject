# Departmental Store Management

This project report outlines the development of a departmental store management system that utilizes database design and user interface (UI) creation. The system aims to streamline the store's inventory management, sales tracking, and customer relations management.

## Overview
Departmental stores are facing various challenges in managing their inventory, tracking sales, and maintaining customer relations. Many stores rely on manual systems that are time-consuming and error-prone, resulting in poor customer service, stockouts, and loss of sales. To address these issues, there is a need for a digital management system that can automate store processes, provide real-time inventory updates, and track sales data. This project aims to create a departmental store management system that uses database design and UI creation to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of store operations, resulting in improved customer satisfaction, increased sales, and reduced costs.

## Methodology
To develop the departmental store management system, a comprehensive methodology was followed, encompassing the stages of data gathering, schema design, and user interface (UI) creation. This section provides an overview of the step-by-step process undertaken to achieve the desired outcomes.

1. Data Gathering: Based on the gathered data, a detailed database schema was created to represent the various entities and their relationships. The team analyzed the requirements and identified key entities, including products, employees, customers, suppliers, orders, and payments.

2. Schema Design: The schema consisted of primary keys, foreign keys, and the necessary constraints to maintain data integrity. For example, the Customer table contained fields such as CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, and Address, while the Orders table included attributes like OrderID, ProductID, and EmployeeID.

3. UI Creation: Simultaneously with the schema design, the team focused on developing the user interface (UI) for the management system. The UI was created using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Bootstrap framework. The goal was to design an interface that would facilitate easy navigation and efficient data entry.

4. UI Design: The UI design incorporated a visually appealing layout with well-organized sections for different functionalities. Elements were created to facilitate data entry, retrieval, and manipulation. CSS styling was applied to enhance the visual presentation, while JavaScript and Bootstrap were utilized to add functionality and responsiveness to the UI.

5. Normalization: In order to ensure data integrity, eliminate redundancy, and improve database performance, the tables in the departmental store management system were normalized up to the third normal form (3NF). This involved breaking down tables into smaller, more focused entities and arranging them in a way that reduced redundancy.

The seamless integration of database design and UI creation laid the foundation for an effective system that streamlines inventory management, sales tracking, and customer relations in the departmental store. It enables efficient data management and meets the needs of the store staff.
